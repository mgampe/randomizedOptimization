Randomized Optimization Experiements with MLRose

This document outlines the set up for randomized_optimization_P2.ipynb

Data and code can be found online at https://github.com/mgampe/randomizedOptimization

Please visit the site to download all necessary data and code. To run the code, place the data files in the same directory as the code and the run the script with the appropriate python interpreter. This was tested to run in VSCode and jupyter notebook.

randomized_optimization_P2.ipynb is a script for training, testing, optimizing, and comparing a neural net using differnet randomized optimization algorithms to set the weights. The second part of the notebook applies random hill climb, simulated annealing, genetic algorithm, and mimic to 3 different optimization problems and measures their respective performance.

python version: 3.8.2 64 bit

Data requirements: Provided with the code on github
